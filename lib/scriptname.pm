=head1 NAME

scriptname - Locate original perl script


=head1 VERSION

This document describes scriptname version 0.5


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use scriptname;
    use lib scriptname::mydir . '/../lib';

or

    use scriptname lib => '../lib';

or

    use scriptname ':all';
    my $scriptbasename = mybase;

you can also use

    no scriptname lib => '../lib';

to remove a relative path from C<@INC>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Locates the full path to the current script's directory to allow the
use of of paths relative to the script's directory. Also, unshift
paths relative to the script's directory in @INC.

This allows a user to setup a directory tree for some software with
directories C<< <root>/bin >> and C<< <root>/lib >>, and then the above
example will allow the use of modules in the lib directory without knowing
where the software tree is installed, even if the name by which the script
was called is a symbolic link to the path where the C<../bin> and the
C<../lib> actually are.

If perl is invoked using the B<-e> option or the perl script is read from
C<STDIN> then the module sets C<mydir> to the current working
directory.

=head1 EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS

=over

=item C<< myname >>

fully qualified path for the script (with all links resolved), undef if called
from C<-e> or C<STDIN>

=item C<< mybase >>

basename of C<myname>, or undef

=item C<< mydir >>

dirname of C<myname>, or the current working directory if called from C<-e> or C<STDIN>

=back

The result of C<myname> is also put in C<$0> unless called from C<-e> or C<STDIN>.


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item C<< chdir() too early >>

The module croaks if the script can manage to call C<chdir()> before the

  use scriptname;

Please, don't do that.

=back

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

The module can, under some circumstances, not croak even if the
the script called C<chdir()> before the C<use>.
In that case, the returned results can be WRONG. So, as I said,
please, don't do that.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

perl5.8 and the standard modules C<File::Basename>, C<Carp>,
C<Exporter>, C<Cwd> and C<lib>.

Also depends on C<version>.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

=head2 Differences from C<< FindBin >>

C<scriptname> does not search B<PATH>. It makes one of the following assumptions:

=over

=item C<$0> comes with an absolute filename (starting from root)

This can happen:

=over

=item *

When the script was called with B<perl -S> -- in this case, perl looked the B<PATH> for the script;

=item *

When the script was called with B<perl> I<absolute_file_name>;

=item *

When the script was called by the shebang and the shell/kernel (whoever
interpreted the shebang) was passed pathless command name -- 
when the shell/kernel searched the B<PATH> and found the file,
it passes the absolute filename to B<perl>;

=item *

When the script was called by the shebang and the shell/kernel was
passed an absolute filename --
when this is the case, the shell/kernel passes the absolute pathname unaltered to
B<perl>.

=back

=item C<$0> comes with a filename relative to the current directory

This happens:

=over

=item *

When the script was called with B<perl> I<relative_file_name> -- B<perl> will
search the filename under the current directory;

=item *

When the script was called by the shebang and the shell/kernel was
passed a relative filename -- when this is the case, the kernel/shell passes
the relative filename to B<perl>, also unaltered.

=back

=back

C<scriptname> follows symbolic links.

And C<scriptname> has the B<lib> option, to prepend library paths relative
to C<scriptname::mydir> to B<@INC>.
